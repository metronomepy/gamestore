MVC5 university project

We create an online product catalog that users can browse by category and page, a shopping cart where users can add and remove products, and a payment form where users can enter shipping information. In addition, we will create an administration area that includes tools for managing the product catalog (create, read, update, delete - CRUD) and securing it so that changes can only be made by registered administrators.

There were 2 ways to choose a design pattern: ASP.NET Web Forms or ASP.NET MVC 5. Web Forms provide the ability to prepare this project faster and easier, but was chosen MVC 5. This was done because we build an application with an efficient and maintainable architecture that requires the sharing of responsibilities.
We create Unit tests on the fly, and they allow us to test the behavior of the application in a natural way, which is almost impossible with complex web form management.
MVC 5 is a new technology that keeps abreast of new web technologies such as HTML5, Ajax, Web API, SignalR, OAuth, Identity 2.0, and more. You don't need to learn them to learn MVC, but you can use them in MVC.
